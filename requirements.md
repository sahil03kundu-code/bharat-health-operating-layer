# AI-Powered Rural Healthcare Triage System – Requirements

## 1. Problem Statement
India’s healthcare system faces a critical imbalance between patient demand and available medical professionals, especially in rural and semi-rural regions. While national programs and physical infrastructure exist, access to timely care remains inconsistent due to delayed detection, fragmented follow-up, and overburdened frontline health workers and doctors.

Most rural patients seek care only when symptoms become severe, not because services are unavailable, but because the system lacks a mechanism to continuously observe risk and guide escalation over time. Healthcare interactions are episodic, data is siloed, and patients often disappear between visits, leading to preventable complications and unnecessary hospital load.

The core problem is not the absence of doctors or schemes, but the absence of a continuous triage and coordination layer that can monitor patient risk over time, prioritize attention, and ensure early intervention without overwhelming limited medical resources.

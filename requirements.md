# AI-Powered Rural Healthcare Triage System – Requirements

## 1. Problem Statement
India’s healthcare system faces a critical imbalance between patient demand and available medical professionals, especially in rural and semi-rural regions. While national programs and physical infrastructure exist, access to timely care remains inconsistent due to delayed detection, fragmented follow-up, and overburdened frontline health workers and doctors.

Most rural patients seek care only when symptoms become severe, not because services are unavailable, but because the system lacks a mechanism to continuously observe risk and guide escalation over time. Healthcare interactions are episodic, data is siloed, and patients often disappear between visits, leading to preventable complications and unnecessary hospital load.

The core problem is not the absence of doctors or schemes, but the absence of a continuous triage and coordination layer that can monitor patient risk over time, prioritize attention, and ensure early intervention without overwhelming limited medical resources.


## 2. Objective
The objective of this system is to provide a voice-first, AI-assisted healthcare triage layer that continuously tracks patient symptoms over time and supports timely escalation to appropriate human care. The system is designed to structure symptom input, assess risk conservatively, and ensure follow-up without performing diagnosis or prescribing treatment. By acting as a coordination and risk-visibility layer between patients, frontline health workers, and doctors, the system aims to reduce delayed care while optimizing limited medical resources.


## 3. Target Users
The primary users of the system include individuals from rural and semi-rural communities who face barriers to timely healthcare access, particularly due to distance, language, or literacy limitations.

Secondary users include caregivers and family members who often make healthcare decisions on behalf of patients in the Indian context.

Tertiary users include frontline health workers such as ASHA and ANM staff, as well as doctors at PHC and CHC levels, who receive structured, prioritized cases for review and intervention.


## 4. System Scope
The system provides a voice-first interface for capturing patient-reported symptoms and relevant contextual information, converts this input into structured data, and applies AI-assisted triage logic to assess risk and determine appropriate follow-up or escalation.

The system maintains patient continuity by tracking symptom changes over time and triggering follow-up actions when risk increases or when expected responses are missed.

The system supports escalation workflows to frontline health workers or doctors by presenting prioritized cases with summarized history and symptom trends.

The system does not perform medical diagnosis, prescribe medication, or replace clinical judgment. All medical decisions and treatments remain the responsibility of qualified healthcare professionals.

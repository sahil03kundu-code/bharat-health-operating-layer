# System Design – AI-Powered Healthcare Triage Layer

## 1. Design Overview
This system is designed as a voice-first, AI-assisted healthcare triage layer that operates between patients and the formal healthcare system. It focuses on continuous risk observation rather than one-time consultations, enabling early detection of worsening conditions and timely human intervention.

The architecture follows a layered approach that separates access, intelligence, and care delivery to ensure clarity, safety, and scalability. AI is intentionally constrained to assist with symptom structuring, risk assessment, and trend detection, while all medical decisions remain with human healthcare professionals.

The design prioritizes reliability, responsible AI use, and real-world deployment in rural and semi-rural Indian contexts, where literacy, language diversity, and connectivity constraints must be addressed.


## 2. High-Level Architecture
The system follows a layered architecture that separates access, intelligence, and care delivery to ensure safety, clarity, and scalability.

Patients and caregivers interact with the system through voice-first interfaces, including IVR-based phone access and lightweight mobile applications. These inputs are converted into structured symptom data through guided questioning.

The structured data flows into the Intelligence Layer, where risk scoring and trend analysis are performed. This layer evaluates both current symptoms and changes over time to identify patients requiring attention.

Based on risk and trend signals, cases are categorized for routine follow-up, community health worker review, or doctor escalation.

The Care Layer presents prioritized cases to ASHA workers and doctors, along with concise patient history and symptom trends.

AI outputs remain advisory, while all medical decisions and interventions are executed by human healthcare professionals.

The architecture is designed to operate reliably under low-connectivity conditions and supports incremental scaling across regions and programs.



## 3. Layered System Design

### 3.1 Access Layer
The Access Layer serves as the entry point into the system and is designed to minimize literacy, language, and technology barriers.

Patients, caregivers, or family members can initiate interaction either by calling a designated phone number (IVR-based access) or through a lightweight mobile application when available. Voice interaction is the primary mode of input.

Users describe their symptoms in natural speech. The system supports multiple officially recognized Indian languages and is architected to progressively extend support to additional regional languages and dialects.

This layer performs structured symptom intake by guiding users through follow-up questions such as symptom type, duration, age group, and perceived severity. It captures standardized inputs for downstream AI triage.

No diagnosis, treatment advice, or medical decisions are made at this layer.


### 3.2 Intelligence Layer
The Intelligence Layer acts as the system’s decision-support core and is responsible for AI-assisted triage and continuous risk monitoring.

This layer converts structured symptom inputs into an initial risk score using a conservative triage logic. The system is intentionally designed to favor escalation over missed detection, especially during early or uncertain interactions.

Risk assessment is performed using a hybrid approach that combines deterministic rules (for known red flags and safety thresholds) with probabilistic scoring (to handle uncertainty and variation in symptom descriptions). The output is a triage recommendation rather than a diagnosis.

A key component of this layer is the Trend Engine. Instead of relying on single interactions, the system tracks symptom changes over time. Risk scores are recalculated across follow-up interactions to detect worsening patterns that may not be evident in isolation.

The system explicitly distinguishes between deterministic decisions (such as mandatory escalation triggers) and probabilistic assessments (such as gradual risk elevation). This separation improves transparency, auditability, and trust.

The Intelligence Layer does not prescribe treatment or make final medical decisions. It generates triage signals and follow-up requirements for human healthcare workers.


### 3.3 Care Layer
The Care Layer represents the human execution layer of the system, where healthcare professionals review and act on AI-assisted triage outputs.

This layer is accessed by ASHA and ANM workers at the community level and by doctors at the PHC or CHC level. Healthcare workers are shown only cases that require attention based on escalation signals generated by the Intelligence Layer.

For each case, the system presents a concise patient history, symptom trends over time, and AI-generated triage suggestions. These suggestions are advisory in nature and do not function as commands or prescriptions.

Healthcare workers retain full authority to make final medical decisions, initiate treatment, recommend referrals, or override system suggestions based on clinical judgment and contextual knowledge.

By filtering low-risk cases and prioritizing patients showing worsening trends, the Care Layer reduces cognitive load on healthcare workers while enabling earlier intervention for high-risk cases.


## 4. Data Flow & Continuity
Patient interactions generate structured symptom records that are stored as time-ordered entries linked to a persistent patient identity. Each new interaction is evaluated in the context of prior data to assess changes in risk over time.

Risk scores, escalation decisions, and follow-up actions are recorded to maintain continuity of care. This longitudinal data enables trend-based evaluation rather than isolated assessments.

Data flow between layers is controlled and purpose-specific, ensuring only relevant information is exposed to healthcare workers while maintaining patient privacy and system safety.


## 5. Safety & Responsibility Principles
The system is designed with conservative safety principles to minimize the risk of delayed or missed care.

AI-generated outputs are limited to risk categorization and escalation suggestions. The system does not provide diagnoses, prescriptions, or treatment instructions at any stage.

Risk assessment prioritizes sensitivity over specificity, favoring escalation when uncertainty exists. This reduces the likelihood of under-triaging potentially serious conditions.

Human healthcare workers retain full authority to override AI suggestions at all times. Overrides are treated as expected outcomes rather than exceptions.

To mitigate errors from single interactions, the system relies on trend-based evaluation rather than isolated symptom snapshots. Worsening patterns over time trigger automatic escalation.

In cases of system failure, connectivity loss, or uncertain inputs, the system defaults to recommending human review rather than automated triage.


## 6. Scalability & Extensibility
The system is designed with a modular architecture that enables scaling across regions and user volumes without core changes. Language support and triage logic are extensible, allowing gradual expansion and policy updates. Clear integration boundaries support future connections with public health systems while maintaining reliability and safety.


## 7. Design Decisions & Trade-offs
The design prioritizes safety and real-world deployability over aggressive automation. AI is intentionally constrained to triage and trend detection, with all medical decisions retained by humans. A voice-first interface was chosen to maximize accessibility, accepting reduced input precision as a trade-off mitigated by structured follow-up. Conservative escalation logic favors sensitivity over efficiency to reduce the risk of missed care.

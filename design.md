# System Design – AI-Powered Healthcare Triage Layer

## 1. Design Overview
This system is designed as a voice-first, AI-assisted healthcare triage layer that operates between patients and the formal healthcare system. It focuses on continuous risk observation rather than one-time consultations, enabling early detection of worsening conditions and timely human intervention.

The architecture follows a layered approach that separates access, intelligence, and care delivery to ensure clarity, safety, and scalability. AI is intentionally constrained to assist with symptom structuring, risk assessment, and trend detection, while all medical decisions remain with human healthcare professionals.

The design prioritizes reliability, responsible AI use, and real-world deployment in rural and semi-rural Indian contexts, where literacy, language diversity, and connectivity constraints must be addressed.
